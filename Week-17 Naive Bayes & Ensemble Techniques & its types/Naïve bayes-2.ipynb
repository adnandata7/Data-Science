    "- **Multinomial Naive Bayes** is used for count-based features, such as word frequencies in text classification.\n",

    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "From the results, the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier is likely to perform the best for this dataset. This is because the **Spambase dataset** primarily consists of word frequencies, which aligns well with the assumptions of the Multinomial Naive Bayes model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Naive Bayes** might not perform as well because it assumes binary features (presence or absence of a word rather than frequency). While it can still provide decent results, it may lose some important information about word frequency distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gaussian Naive Bayes** typically works better for continuous data and may not be the best choice for text-based datasets like Spambase. However, after standardizing the dataset, its performance can still be competitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "- **Feature independence assumption**: Naive Bayes assumes that features are independent, which is rarely true in real-world data. This can limit its effectiveness compared to more complex models.\n",
    "- **Sensitivity to feature distribution**: Gaussian Naive Bayes assumes a normal distribution of features, which may not always be the case.\n",
    "- **Not ideal for highly correlated features**: If features are highly correlated, Naive Bayes may struggle to make accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the **Multinomial Naive Bayes** classifier is the most suitable for this problem due to its ability to handle frequency-based data efficiently. **Bernoulli Naive Bayes** can still be useful but is more suited for binary features, while **Gaussian Naive Bayes** is better for continuous numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future improvements, potential enhancements could include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature Engineering**: Experimenting with different feature extraction techniques, such as **TF-IDF**, could improve classification accuracy.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Models**: Combining Naive Bayes with other classifiers (e.g., **SVM** or **Random Forest**) could address some of its limitations.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Adjusting parameters such as smoothing factors could optimize model performance.\n",
    "- **Handling Correlated Features**: Using dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA** could help improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, **Naive Bayes remains a strong baseline model** for text classification tasks due to its **simplicity, efficiency, and interpretability**.\n"
