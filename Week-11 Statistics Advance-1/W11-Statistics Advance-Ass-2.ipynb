    "### **Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**(i). PMF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability of each possible outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a function that maps each possible value to its probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(ii). PDF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is used for continuous random variables and represents the likelihood of the variable taking on a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives the probability density at each point.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: For a fair six-sided die, the PMF assigns a probability of 1/6 to each face (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, for a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 1, the PDF is constant, and the area under the curve between any two points is proportional to the probability.\n",
    "\n",

    "### **Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDF**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. \n",
    "\n",
    "It accumulates probabilities as you move along the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: The CDF of a fair six-sided die would show that the probability of rolling a 3 or less is 1/2 (because there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### **Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model? Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal distribution can model situations like heights of individuals, errors in measurements, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean (μ) determines the center of the distribution.\n",
    "- Standard deviation (σ) determines the spread. A higher σ leads to a wider distribution.\n",

    "### **Q5: What is Bernoulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bernoulli Distribution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "It models a single binary outcome (e.g., success or failure).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example*: Coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difference**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli is for a single trial, while Binomial extends to multiple independent trials.\n",

    "### **Q6. Consider a dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10. If we assume that the dataset is normally distributed, what is the probability that a randomly selected observation will be greater than 60? Use the appropriate formula and show your calculations.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The formula to calculate the z-score is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\frac{X - \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $X$ is the value you want to find the probability for (in this case, 60).\n",
    "- $\\mu$ is the mean of the dataset (50).\n",
    "- $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the dataset (10).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the z-score for $X=60$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Z = \\frac{60 - 50}{10} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a standard normal distribution table, the probability associated with $Z=1$ is approximately 0.8413. This means that the probability of randomly selecting an observation greater than 60 from this normally distributed dataset is approximately **0.8413, i.e., 84.13%.**\n",

    "Uniform Distribution has constant probability over a specified range. These are of two types:\n",

    "(i). Continuous Uniform Distribution\n",
