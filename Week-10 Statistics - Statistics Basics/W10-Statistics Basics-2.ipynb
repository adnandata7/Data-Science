    "#### Q2. What is the difference between the mean, median, and mode? How are they used to measure the central tendency of a dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: The mean is the average of all data points in a dataset. It is calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values. It is used when the data is symmetrically distributed without outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is the middle value of a dataset when the values are arranged in ascending or descending order. If the number of values is even, it is the average of the two middle numbers. It is used when the data is skewed or has outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is the most frequently occurring value in a dataset. It is used for categorical data to identify the most common category or for any dataset to determine the most frequent value.\n",

    "#### Q8. What do you understand about skewness in data?\n",
    "\n",
    "Skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the distribution of values in a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right (Positive) Skew: The tail on the right side is longer or fatter than the left side. The mean is greater than the median.  \n",
    "Left (Negative) Skew: The tail on the left side is longer or fatter than the right side. The mean is less than the median.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q9. If a data is right skewed then what will be the position of median with respect to mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a right-skewed (positively skewed) distribution, the median is typically less than the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q10. Explain the difference between covariance and correlation. How are these measures used in statistical analysis?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance: Covariance measures the directional relationship between two variables. If the covariance is positive, the variables tend to increase together; if negative, one variable tends to increase when the other decreases. However, it does not standardize the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation: Correlation measures both the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables and standardizes the value to fall between -1 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: If you have data on height and weight, covariance might show a positive value indicating they increase together. Correlation would show the strength of this relationship, say 0.8, indicating a strong positive relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q11. What is the formula for calculating the sample mean? Provide an example calculation for a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for calculating the sample mean is:\n",

    "Sample Mean\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q12. For a normal distribution data what is the relationship between its measure of central tendency?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q13. How is covariance different from correlation?\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance indicates the direction of the linear relationship between variables but does not provide the strength or standardized measure. Correlation, on the other hand, standardizes this measure to a range between -1 and 1, providing both direction and strength of the linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q14. How do outliers affect measures of central tendency and dispersion? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outliers can significantly affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can skew the mean, making it higher or lower than the median and mode.  \n",
    "Median: Less affected by outliers, as it is the middle value.  \n",
    "Mode: Not affected by outliers, as it is the most frequent value.  \n",
    "Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation: Outliers can increase these measures, indicating a higher spread in the data.  \n",
    "Example: In the dataset [1, 2, 2, 3, 100], the mean is skewed to 21.6, whereas the median is 2, and the mode is 2. The standard deviation is high due to the outlier 100."
