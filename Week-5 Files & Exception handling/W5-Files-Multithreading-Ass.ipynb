    "Advantages of Multithreading:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Responsiveness: Multithreading allows applications to remain responsive to user interactions while performing long-running tasks in the background. This is particularly beneficial in user interfaces and interactive applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Threads enable multiple tasks to execute concurrently within the same process, utilizing available CPU cores efficiently. This can lead to improved performance, especially for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resource Sharing: Threads within the same process can share resources such as memory space, which can simplify communication and data sharing between different parts of an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified Code: In some cases, multithreading can simplify complex code by allowing different parts of an application to run independently but within the same program context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Multithreading enables true parallelism on multi-core systems, where multiple threads can execute simultaneously, accelerating computations and improving overall throughput.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity and Synchronization: Multithreaded programming introduces complexity due to the need for synchronization mechanisms (like locks, mutexes, and semaphores) to coordinate access to shared resources. Improper synchronization can lead to issues such as race conditions and deadlocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Increased Overhead: Creating and managing threads requires system resources (memory and CPU time). While threads can enhance performance in certain scenarios, excessive threading can lead to resource contention and overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty in Debugging: Multithreaded programs can be harder to debug and reason about compared to single-threaded programs. Issues such as timing-dependent bugs (e.g., race conditions) may not manifest consistently and can be challenging to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential for Reduced Stability: Improperly managed threads can impact application stability. For example, a deadlock where threads are waiting indefinitely for each other to release resources can cause the application to hang.\n",
    "\n",
    "Portability: Thread behavior and performance can vary across different operating systems and hardware platforms. Writing portable multithreaded code that behaves predictably across all platforms can be challenging."

    "\n",
    "Race Condition:  \n",
